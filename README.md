# BCNN_keras
Bilinear CNN is simple yet powerful model for Fine-Grained Visual Classification task.
it is still competitive though developed more than 3 years ago.

In this demo, I implemented BCNN D-D model with keras.
BCNN leverage pre-trained networks.
D-D model use two identical VGG16 as backbone.
